# Recipe Box
A simple front-end application, written in React and Redux

This project was made to explore the use of React and Redux using [this FreeCodeCamp project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-recipe-box) as a starting point. It has been built to give others some experience using Redux and React.

## Brief:
* Create a Recipe Box app that adheres to the user stories in the linked FreeCodeCamp project
* Verify that the functionality is correct according to the brief by employing unit tests
* Create a Redux store to hold the application state
* Build a reducer and Redux actions to affect changes to the application state
* Use prop-types in components to verify that props are passed in correctly where applicable
